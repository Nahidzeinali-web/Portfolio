# üëã Hi there ‚Äî I'm Nahid Zeinali

I‚Äôm a Senior AI Research and data Scientist with 9+ years of hands-on experience at the intersection of software engineering, healthcare, and artificial intelligence. I hold a Ph.D. in Informatics from the University of Iowa, where my work focused on leveraging NLP, LLMs, and deep learning to transform clinical decision support.

Currently, I work at the California Medical Innovation Institute, developing AI-powered tools and LLM pipelines for research data management and biomedical informatics. I specialize in designing end-to-end ML and LLMOps systems, from data ingestion and model development to scalable deployment using cloud-native and containerized solutions.

  Built a FAIR-compliant ophthalmic imaging pipeline using Croissant metadata. Enabled AI-readiness and standardized data sharing for disease analysis and machine learning workflows.

- **Symptom Detection in Cancer Patients**  
  Developed and fine-tuned multiple LLMs (BERT, GPT, LLaMA) on Electronic Health Records (EHRs) to extract 13 cancer symptoms and palliative care indicators using prompt tuning, embedding techniques, and named entity recognition (NER).

- **Synthetic Clinical Notes Generation**  
  Utilized GPT-4 to generate synthetic, realistic clinical notes for benchmarking models in low-resource domains, improving robustness and external validation in healthcare AI pipelines.

- **OASIS Mobile App for Symptom Prediction**  
  Co-developed an AI-driven mobile app to predict 14 cancer-related symptoms in 18,000+ patients. Contributed deep learning models for personalized recommendations and participated in A/B testing with real patients.

- **AI Chatbot for Rare Disease Literature Mining**  
  Created an LLM-powered chatbot with NIH/NCATS for the RARe-SOURCE‚Ñ¢ project to extract gene-disease associations (e.g., Farber disease) from biomedical literature using LangChain, Ollama, and RAG.

- **Web-based NLP Applications**  
  Built sentiment classifiers and conducted topic modeling and clustering to identify trends and themes from web-based health content using NLTK, Scikit-learn, and custom NLP pipelines.
